Our Story

Is there really such a thing as a National Economy, operating as a single entity and representing the nation as a whole? Or are nations really a collection of many diverse local and regional economies interacting with each other within a national border?

To examine these two narratives, weâ€™ve created an interactive dashboard allowing users to explore geographic concentrations of corporate wealth in the U.S., composed of companies in the S&P 500. 

Our dashboard allows users to compare corporate market capital vs. median household income within the same state. It shows 3 visualizations: 
A US choropleth map of Median Household Income with popups
Hexbin chart of Market Capital with popups
Circle chart of Unemployment Rates with popups
And a Diamond chart of State Revenue with popups

We use PostgreSQL to serve our API. 



Research Questions

How is corporate wealth, as measured by market capital, distributed geographically across the U.S.?
--It seems that Main Street and Wall Street are not representative of each other.

How does corporate wealth compare with median household income (MHI), unemployment rates, and state revenues in the same regions? (Main Street vs. Wall Street comparison)
--While MHI is shows some variation state-to-state (eg. +/- $20k), it is much evenly spread geographically when compared to concentrations of corporate capital.
